# Chapter-2: Creating a Hello World App

What I Learned:
I learned about Flutter's widget tree, which is the hierarchical structure used to build the user interface. Each element in the UI, such as text, buttons, or layouts, is represented as a widget. Additionally, I learned the basics of creating a Flutter app by writing a simple "Hello World" program, including understanding the main() function, runApp() method, and how widgets are composed to define the UI.

Achievement
I successfully built and ran a "Hello World" app on both an emulator and a physical device, ensuring that the Flutter environment is fully functional for development.
